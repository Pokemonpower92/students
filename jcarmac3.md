# CS340 Student README
Heya!  
I'm John Carmack. I'm a senior computer science student. My favorite languages are python  
and javascript (I know this won't make me many friends, but you gotta be yourself). Aside 
from programming I'm really passionate about art. Before the world ended I was also really  
into brazilian jui-jitsu.
